# Secure-And-Private-AI
Here I put up the projects I complete under the Udacity course Secure and Private AI taught by Instructor Andrew Trask.
The projects are in the following order:
- [Generating Private Databases](https://github.com/Abhishek-1Bhatt/Secure-And-Private-AI/blob/main/Generating%20Parallel%20Databases.ipynb)
- [Evaluating The Privacy Of A Function](https://github.com/Abhishek-1Bhatt/Secure-And-Private-AI/blob/main/Evaluating%20The%20Privacy%20Of%20A%20Function.ipynb)
- [L1 Sensitivity With Threshold Function](https://github.com/Abhishek-1Bhatt/Secure-And-Private-AI/blob/main/L1%20Sensitivity%20With%20Threshold%20Function.ipynb)
- [Performing A Simple Differencing Attack On A Database](https://github.com/Abhishek-1Bhatt/Secure-And-Private-AI/blob/main/Performing%20A%20Simple%20Differencing%20Attack%20On%20A%20Database.ipynb)
- [Implementing Local Differential Privacy](https://github.com/Abhishek-1Bhatt/Secure-And-Private-AI/blob/main/Implementing%20Local%20Differential%20Privacy.ipynb)

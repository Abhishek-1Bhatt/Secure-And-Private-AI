This adding the noise after the computation is done because we now need to add less noise and get greater accuracy. This is the case because the function computation reduces the sensitivity to some extent too. Thus, if we can wait to add the noise till after the function computation is done we can get more accurate results."

    "Now we're leavinng the idea of Local Differential Privacy behind. But for Global Differential Privacy we need to know how much noise should be added to the output of our query. Also, there is the question of what type of noise should be added, it can be Laplacian or Gaussian. The amount of noise should also be appropriate to satisfy our privacy budget(epsilon, delta). It is also affected by the sensitivity of the query that we're gonna perform. So, to sum up the amount of noise to be added to the output of our query depends on the following parameters:\n",
    "- The type of noise(Laplacian/Gaussian)\n",
    "- Sensitivity of our query function\n",
    "- Epsilon value\n",
    "- Delta value\n",

    "Now here we're gonna work with Laplacian noise. Secondly the delta value is zero for Laplacian noise. Then the amount of Laplacian noise to be increased or decreased is scaled by a parameter called beta(b), which is given by, \n",
